# Intro: Generators from the ground up

To newcomers and veterans alike, The ES6 toolbox contains a lot of things that make programming JavaScript easier in obvious ways. Embedded in the middle, however, is a tool some find non-obvious: the *generator*. What is this thing? How should I use it in everyday code? Should I use it at all?

Generators are indeed a powerful tool, and I believe that any developer would do well to add them to their repertoire. However, they're closely related to another ES6 feature: *iterators*. Learning one without learning the other builds an incomplete picture and (I believe) has left lots of people confused.

My goal for this tutorial is to make generators easy to understand by starting from the ground up laying out the case for iterators, and then introduce generators as a tool that makes it easy to work with iterators.
