# Generators and Iterators

Generators are a under-appreciated feature of modern JavaScript. I believe this is because generators are just one half of a two-part whole comprising *both generators and iterators*, and that learning one without the other paints an incomplete picture. For myself at least, the ah-ha! moment didn't come until I zoomed out and looked at iterators and generators holistically.

This tutorial follows the same approach. First we lay out the case for iterators, then we move on to generators in order to unify our understanding.
