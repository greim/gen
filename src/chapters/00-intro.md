# Intro: Generators from the ground up

To newcomers and veterans alike, The ES6 toolbox contains a lot of things that make life easier in obvious ways. Embedded in the middle, however, is a tool that some have found strange and non-obvious: the *generator*. What is this thing? How should I use it in everyday code? Should I use it at all?

Generators are indeed a powerful tool, and I believe that any developer would do well to add them to their repertoire. However, it's hard to learn generators without first mastering a broader ES6 feature-set: *iteration*.

If you have some familiarity with ES6 but haven't grappled with generators yet, then this tutorial is for you. We start by introducing ES6 iteration in order to establish context. We then upshift into the world of generators. The power of generators is the power of iteration, and vice versa. Thus, along the way we maintain a focus on both. At the end, we briefly tour some advanced concepts.
