# Intro: Generators from the ground up

The ES6 toolbox contains lots of things that make life easier in ways that are obvious to newcomers. Embedded in the middle of it, however, is a strange and vaguely intimidating tool with no obvious use: the *generator*. What is this thing? How should I use it in everyday code? Should I use it at all?

Generators are indeed a powerful tool, and I believe that any developer would do well to add them to their repertoire. In fact, they're closely tied to a larger ES6 feature-set having to do with *iteration*.

If you have some familiarity with ES6 but haven't grappled with generators yet, then this tutorial is for you. We start by looking at ES6 iteration, then we upshift and ease gently into the world of generators. Finally, we briefly tour some advanced concepts.
