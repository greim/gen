# The Yin-Yang of Generators and Iterators

Generators are a poorly-understood feature of modern JavaScript. I believe this is because generators are just one half of a two-part whole comprising *both generators and iterators*, and that learning one without the other paints an incomplete picture. For myself at least, the ah-ha! moment didn't come until I zoomed out and looked at iterators and generators holistically.

This tutorial follows that approach, moving at a gradual pace. First we lay out the case for iterators, then we move on to generators in order to unify our understanding and upshift into a higher plane of awareness.
